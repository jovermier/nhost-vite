# Docker Socket Permissions Fix - Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix Docker socket permission issues in the devcontainer environment.

## Problem

The Docker daemon socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) mounted into the devcontainer had incorrect group ownership, preventing the `node` user from accessing Docker commands. This caused `nhost up` to fail with permission denied errors.

## Solution Overview

Multiple layers of fixes were implemented to ensure robust Docker socket access:

1. **Dockerfile Changes**
2. **Docker Compose Configuration**
3. **DevContainer Configuration**
4. **Automated Scripts**
5. **Manual Fix Script**

## Files Modified

### 1. `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`

- Added the `node` user to the `docker` group during container build
- This ensures the user has proper group membership for Docker socket access

### 2. `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`

- Added explicit user configuration (`1000:1000`)
- Added `group_add` to include docker group GID (`994`)
- This ensures the container runs with proper group access

### 3. `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

- Enhanced docker-in-docker feature configuration
- Added `remoteUser: "node"` to specify the container user
- Improved feature configuration for better Docker integration

### 4. `.devcontainer/post-start.sh`

- Added comprehensive Docker socket permission checking and fixing
- Automatically runs when the container starts
- Includes fallback permissions if standard fixes don't work
- Provides detailed logging of the fix process

### 5. `.devcontainer/fix-docker-permissions.sh` (New)

- Standalone script for manual Docker permission fixes
- Provides detailed diagnostics of socket permissions
- Can be run manually if automatic fixes fail
- Includes multiple fix strategies

### 6. `.devcontainer/README.md`

- Added documentation about Docker socket permission fixes
- Instructions for manual fixes if needed
- Explanation of common errors and solutions

## How It Works

1. **Build Time**: The Dockerfile adds the `node` user to the `docker` group
2. **Container Start**: Docker Compose ensures proper user and group configuration
3. **Post-Start**: The post-start script automatically fixes any remaining permission issues
4. **Manual Backup**: The standalone fix script provides manual intervention capability

## Testing

The fixes can be tested by:

1. Starting the devcontainer
2. Running `docker ps` to verify Docker access
3. Running `nhost up` to ensure Nhost can access Docker
4. If issues persist, running `.devcontainer/fix-docker-permissions.sh`

## Future Considerations

- These fixes should work across different host systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- The Docker group GID (994) may need adjustment on some systems
- The fixes are designed to be idempotent and safe to run multiple times
